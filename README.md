## 🚀 CONTRIBUTE YOUR GAME - GET FEATURED TODAY

**Have a weird game idea? We want it.** 4weird is an **open, contributor-first platform**. Every accepted game gets:

- ✅ **Permanent featuring** on 4weird.games
- ✅ **Dedicated game page** with credits & your bio
- ✅ **Social promotion** across our channels
- ✅ **GitHub contributor credit** in the repo
- ✅ **Backlink to your portfolio** from a live site

### It takes 4 steps to go from idea to live:

```bash
# 1. Fork & clone
gh repo fork mattyjacks/4weird --clone

# 2. Copy the template
cp -r website/v1/games/html/_TEMPLATE website/v1/games/html/yourgame

# 3. Build your game (index.html + game.js + game.css)
# Edit game.json with your credits and bio

# 4. PR and ship
git add . && git commit -m "Add: Your Game Name" && git push
# Open PR -> We review fast -> You're live!
```

### 🎯 The Template Does The Heavy Lifting

Our **`_TEMPLATE/`** folder gives you everything:
- Pre-built game page structure
- Shared nav/footer (automatic)
- Credits section (populated from `game.json`)
- Maker bio section (your story, your links)
- Mobile-ready responsive layout
- "More Games" cross-promotion

**Max 10MB per game.** Big assets? Host externally and link. No build tools needed.
